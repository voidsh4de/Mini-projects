Flappy bird but each click changes the key used to fly

My cousin is good at video games even better than me, but i cant allow that
so because I'm petty, I'm gonna make a game so annoying it makes him quit.

so here's the concept, Flappy bird a game everyone knows how to play you tap you go up, and dont hit the pipes.
but what if you have to find the button that makes you fly?

I'm thinking we display the current button on screen and every press it changes,
but there's one problem	I'm really bad at making games.


So heres where pygame will save me as it is the only tool i know how to make a game in

there's not much more to say so lets get coding
